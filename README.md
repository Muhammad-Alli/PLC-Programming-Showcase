# PLC-Programming-Showcase

This repository contains PLC programs developed using Allen-Bradley Studio 5000. Each program demonstrates specific control logic techniques in Ladder Logic and Function Block Diagram (FBD). The original Studio 5000 project files are not included, as they require proprietary software to open and run. Instead, detailed screenshots of each program are provided to clearly illustrate the implemented logic and design techniques.

## Programs Included:

1. [Switch Logic Equation in FBD](switch_logic_FBD/README.md)
2. [Air Extractor Fan Motor Control](extractor_fan__control/README.md)
4. [Astable Multivibrator with Timer Control](astable_multivibrator_timers/README.md)
5. [Hazardous Gas Safety System (Fail-Safe)](mine_gas_safety_system/README.md)
6. [Add-On Instruction: Alarm Trigger](AOI_alarm_trigger/README.md)
7. [Add-On Instruction: Factory Door Control](AOI_factory_door_control/README.md)
