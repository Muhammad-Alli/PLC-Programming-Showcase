# Switch Logic Equation in FBD

## Requirements
Demonstrate Functional Block Diagram logic (FBD) that produces an output only when:
(Switch3 OR Switch4) AND Switch1 AND Switch2 are energised

## Implementation Summary
- OR block combining Switch3 and Switch4.
- AND blocks ensuring Switch1 and Switch2 must also be active.

## Program Type
- Function Block Diagram

## Notes
- Demonstrates Boolean logic translation and FBD.
